So here I present our software engineering project and yeah, its not much if anything. There is no excuses so with brutal honesty we procrastenaded a lot and didnt get much done but here is what we did.
From this small snippet im sure you can see the vision we had for this game. Albeit its not much its honest work.
This is a turn based game we built from scrath using the RayLib Graphics library, coded in C++. Using Notepad++ for text editing.
The file ChronoQuestCombat.exe is the main file you should look at for gameplay and you can also take a peek at ChronoQuestOverworld.exe which is the experimental gameplay which the player moves through the world, read from a file named map.txt
When you look at ChronoQuestCombat.exe ensure you are on the main branch, and for ChronoQuestOverworld.exe ensure you are on the twin-code branch.
controls for ChronoQuestCombat.exe are primarily left click mouse and to back out of menu's its right click you can also click on the enemy to see him up close.
controls for ChronoQuestOverworld.exe is simply arrow keys.
We know its not much, but this is what we got!
(This game was designed to run on windows machines)
